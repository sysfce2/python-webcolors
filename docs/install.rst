Installation guide
==================

Version |release| of ``webcolors`` is officially tested and supported on the
following versions of Python:

* Python 3.9

* Python 3.10

* Python 3.11

* Python 3.12

* Python 3.13


Installing ``webcolors``
------------------------

To install the latest stable released version of ``webcolors``, run the following
command from a command prompt/terminal:

.. tab:: macOS/Linux/other Unix

   .. code-block:: shell

      python -m pip install --upgrade webcolors

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      py -m pip install --upgrade webcolors

This will use ``pip``, the standard Python package-installation tool. If you
are using a supported version of Python, your installation of Python should
have come with ``pip`` bundled. If ``pip`` does not appear to be present, you
can try running the following from a command prompt/terminal:

.. tab:: macOS/Linux/other Unix

   .. code-block:: shell

      python -m ensurepip --upgrade

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      py -m ensurepip --upgrade

Instructions are also available for `how to obtain and manually install or
upgrade pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/>`_.
